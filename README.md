# W7D1 - In-Class Group Assignment - Secure Blog

## ( I made it all the way to part 5 (Testing with Postman). The part i was unable to complete was testing protected routes. i created a /protected route, obtained the jwt token from the /login route, created a new get request to the /protected route, added the Authorization header with the Bearer value containing my JWT token obtained from the login request. After doing all this i cant get the authorization to work. )
